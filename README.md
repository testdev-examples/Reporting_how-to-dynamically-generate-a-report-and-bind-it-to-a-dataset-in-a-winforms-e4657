<p>If you wish to generate a report based on <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.GridControl.class">GridControl</a>, it is easy to do this by using <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.ReportGeneration.ReportGenerator.class">ReportGenerator</a> as described in the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/114962/Controls-and-Libraries/Data-Grid/Export-and-Printing/Advanced-Grid-Printing-and-Exporting">Advanced Grid Printing and Exporting</a> help article. This component can be used at design time as well as at runtime. <br><br>If you are interested in creating a report from scratch, use the approach described below.<br><br>1. Create a report instance and <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#XtraReports/CustomDocument15034">bind it to data</a>.</p>
<p>2. Add required <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#XtraReports/CustomDocument2590">bands</a> to the report.</p>
<p>3. Add required <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#XtraReports/CustomDocument2605">controls</a> to the created bands and provide data to them.</p>
